# ExcelGuard AI

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)

An **AI-powered validation platform** for financial risk management. Automates Excel workbook validation to identify budget overruns, cash flow issues, and resource allocation problems - reducing analysis time from 40 hours to 2 minutes.

**Built for Big 4 Risk Advisory** where analysts manually validated project financials across 200+ engagements. Due to data confidentiality requirements, cloud-based solutions (OpenAI, external APIs) could not be used as sensitive client financial data cannot be transmitted to external servers. This necessitated a fully local solution with all processing occurring on-premise.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized validation agents (Rule Interpreter, Smart Validator, Anomaly Detector) working in parallel
- **AI Rule Suggestions**: Analyzes data patterns and recommends validation rules automatically using statistical methods (IQR, pattern recognition) - no external API calls required
- **100% Local Processing**: All validation runs on-premise; no data transmitted to cloud services or external APIs (OpenAI, etc.) ensuring client confidentiality
- **Fast**: Validates 500K+ cells in under 20 seconds using parallel processing
- **Smart Validation**: Cross-sheet logic, temporal patterns, conditional sums, gap detection
